# Express React Webpack Boilerplate
At last, a boilerplate that I understand inside and out, because I built it.

## How to use
`git clone` this repository
`npm install` to install the modules & dependencies
`rm -rf .git && git init` to remove git tracking on this repo and start a new git
Create a new repo on Github (or your repository service of choice) and copy the url (e.g. https://github.com/user/repo.git)
`git remote add origin [new repo URL]` to link this project with the new remote repo
`git remote -v` to verify new remote url has been added
Commit and push and then get building!
